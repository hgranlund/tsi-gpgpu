# Cuda vs OpenCL

Cuda is faster, but openCL is more portable.


### Pros and cons
* Search results (papers, links to online resources, etc) for NVIDIA outnumber results for AMD 6:1.
*

### Cuda
* Well documentated.
* Debugger support (cuda-gdb).
* Support openACC (openACC is like OpenMP, but it also support GPU's).
* Great Community.
*


### OpenCL
* Just in time (JIT).
