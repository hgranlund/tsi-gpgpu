The quest for a fast KNN search
===============================

Something general about kNN search. We will study for three dimensions.

Brute force based effort
------------------------

* General overview of the method.
* Reference to literature.
* Some reasoning about speed.
* Some results.
* Bottlenecks.
* Some ideas of what can be improved.


KD-tree based effort
--------------------

* General overview of the method.
* Reference to literature.
* Some reasoning about speed.
* Some results.
* Bottlenecks.
* Some ideas of what can be improved.

Final thoughts
--------------

* Access to [CUKNN: A parallel implementation of K-nearest neighbor on CUDA-enabled GPU](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=5382329) paper.
