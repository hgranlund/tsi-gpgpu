# Progress



### Read
* CUDA by examples.
    * It is a good book to learn the basic of CUDA programming.
* Garcia and E. Debreuve and F. Nielsen and M. Barlaud. k-nearest neighbor search: fast GPU-based implementations and application to high-dimensional feature matching. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP), Hong Kong, China, September 2010.
    * Garcia's algorithm is based on a brute-force implementation, using Euclidean distance and a modified/parallelized insertion sort algorithm.
* Improving the k-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm with CUDA by Graham Nolan.
    * Improves Garcias algorithm with a bitonic sort
    * Stats that Brute-force is better then kn-tree when implementing kNN on GPU.



### TODO
* Start investigating Garcia's Knn-algorithm.
* Improve Garcia's algorithm.
