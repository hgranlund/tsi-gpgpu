In Section~\ref{sec:development_of_a_parallel_k_d_tree_build_algorithm}, we introduced RQ~\ref{rq:parallel_build}, which questions the potential benefits if parallelizing the k-d tree build.   


\textbf{RQ~\ref{rq:parallel_build}.} \emph{It is possible to parallelize the k-d tree build algorithm, in such a way that it gives a significant speed improvement compared to the serial algorithm.}

The hard parallelization nature of the k-d tree was discussed and investigated, along the way some intermediate results was presented. 
we discussed the hard nature of parallelizing the k-d tree build.

\textbf{RQ~\ref{rq:parallel_query}.} \emph{It is possible to parallelize the All-kNN query algorithm, in such a way that it gives a significant speed improvement compared to the serial algorithm.}

Graph of serial and parallel build, and query.

Some speedup calculation. Include Garcia as well, and point out that high speedup does not equal fast algorithm.
