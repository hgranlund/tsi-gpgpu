abstract    =   "The rapid increase in the performance of graphics hardware, coupled with recent improvements in its programmability, have made graphics hardware a compelling platform for computationally demanding tasks in a wide variety of application domains. In this report, we describe, summarize, and analyze the latest research in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware. We begin with the technical motivations that underlie general-purpose computation on graphics processors (GPGPU) and describe the hardware and software developments that have led to the recent interest in this field. We then aim the main body of this report at two separate audiences. First, we describe the techniques used in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware. We believe these techniques will be generally useful for researchers who plan to develop the next generation of GPGPU algorithms and techniques. Second, we survey and categorize the latest developments in general-purpose application development on graphics hardware.",

@inproceedings{peng1997,
	abstract = {Internet has been changing the ways of data access, sharing and dissemination. It is further changing the means of analysis and visualization of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Internet GIS is rapidly evolving as Internet and Web technologies change. Internet GIS is a network-centric GIS tool that uses Internet as a major means to access and transmit distributed data and analysis tool modules, and to conduct analysis and visualization. While many early Internet-based GIS services links World Wide Web and GIS server with the Common Gateway Interface, most recent Internet GIS focuses more on applications on the Web client side. The client-side Internet GIS using GIS plug-ins, ActiveX controls, and Java applets offers better interactions between the end users and GIS on the Internet. This paper discusses the working procedures of each technique, assesses their pros and cons, and addresses performance and security issues in the evolvement of Internet GIS.},
