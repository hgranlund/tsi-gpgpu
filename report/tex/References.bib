@inproceedings{peng1997,
	abstract = {Internet has been changing the ways of data access, sharing and dissemination. It is further changing the means of analysis and visualization of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Internet GIS is rapidly evolving as Internet and Web technologies change. Internet GIS is a network-centric GIS tool that uses Internet as a major means to access and transmit distributed data and analysis tool modules, and to conduct analysis and visualization. While many early Internet-based GIS services links World Wide Web and GIS server with the Common Gateway Interface, most recent Internet GIS focuses more on applications on the Web client side. The client-side Internet GIS using GIS plug-ins, ActiveX controls, and Java applets offers better interactions between the end users and GIS on the Internet. This paper discusses the working procedures of each technique, assesses their pros and cons, and addresses performance and security issues in the evolvement of Internet GIS.},
