Most software tools for KBE development is today based around special purpose Modeling
frameworks like AML. While this approach has been very successful, there is still room for
improvement. This project aims at investigating the possible benefits of utilizing
general purpose software development tools as a part of KBE development. The following
areas of interest will be studied, with KBE development at Aker Solution KBeDesign serving
as a case study. Integration of general purpose software development tools into the AML
modeling framework. Usage of general purpose software development tools for
KBE development alongside the AML modeling framework. Usage of general purpose
Software development as standalone tools for KBEdevelopment.
