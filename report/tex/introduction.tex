\chapter{Introduction}

Most software tools for KBE development is today based around special purpose Modeling frameworks like the AML KBE language developed by TechnoSoft Inc. While this approach has been very successful there are continuously requirements for extending the capabilities both regarding new functionality and computational performance. TechnoSoft would like to have certain algorithms sped up, by utilizing general-purpose computing on graphics processing units (GPGPU). The goal of the master thesis will be to implement a small library of GPGPU-enhanced algorithms that could be used in TechnoSoft applications. The technology to be investigated is NVIDIA http://www.nvidia.com/page/technologies.html including the CUDA architechure and OpenCL. Towards the end of the work with the master assignment, when algorithms for grid smoothing for CFD analysis are developed, the candidates will study if these algorithms are well suited for speed up by graphic processor implementation.

The assignment includes:

A study of advantages offered by using GPGPU. How to best utilize the high capacity for parallel processing? What kind of problems can be sped up?

An evaluation of suitable GPGPU tools. Should development be based on OpenCL or CUDA?

An evaluation of GPGPU libraries like ViennaCL and cuBLAS.

Select engineering algorithms for test applications, in cooperation with the advisers, that are well suited and relevant for speed up by implementation on the graphic processor.

Extensive performance testing of different implementations on different problem sizes and hardware. Are we getting good speed up on real life problems and hardware, or is the overhead associated with parallel computing hampering performance?



Cover the assignment, and the changes made during our work. Changes made during the course of our work is mentioned, and our new specification is defined.

We move on to give a presentation of the problem given by TSI.
